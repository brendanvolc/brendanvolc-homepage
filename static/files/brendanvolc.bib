	abstract = {The Azores archipelago is composed of nine volcanic islands located at the triple junction between the North American, Eurasian and Nubian plates. Nowadays the volcanic activity in the archipelago is characterized by the presence of secondary manifestations of volcanism, such as hydrothermal fumaroles, thermal and cold CO2-rich springs as well as soil diffuse degassing areas, and low magnitude seismicity. Soil CO2 degassing (concentration and flux) surveys have been performed at Pico, Faial and São Jorge islands to identify possible diffuse degassing structures. Since the settlement of the Azores in the 15th Century these three islands were affected by seven onshore volcanic eruptions and at least six destructive earthquakes. These islands are crossed by numerous active tectonic structures with dominant WNW-ESE direction, and less abundant conjugate NNW-SSE trending faults. A total of 2855 soil CO2 concentration measurements have been carried out with values varying from 0 to 20.7 vol.\%. Soil CO2 flux measurements, using the accumulation chamber method, have also been performed at Pico and Faial islands in the summer of 2011 and values varied from absence of CO2 to 339 g m-2 d-1. The highest CO2 emissions were recorded at Faial Island and were associated with the Pedro Miguel graben faults, which seem to control the CO2 diffuse degassing and were interpreted as the pathways for the CO2 ascending from deep reservoirs to the surface. At São Jorge Island, four main degassing zones have been identified at the intersection of faults or associated to WNW-ESE tectonic structures. Four diffuse degassing structures were identified at Pico Island essentially where different faults intersect. Pico geomorphology is dominated by a 2351 m high central volcano that presents several steam emissions at its summit. These emissions are located along a NW-SE fault and the highest measured soil CO2 concentration reached 7.6 vol.\% with a maximum temperature of 77 ºC. The diffuse degassing maps show that anomalous CO2 degassing areas are controlled essentially by the tectonic structures and the lithology of the sites since the youngest volcanic systems are characterized by very low CO2 emissions.},

	abstract = {Bagana, an andesite lava cone on Bougainville Island, Papua New Guinea, is thought to be a very young central volcano. We have tested this idea by estimating the volumes of lava extruded over different time intervals (1-, 2-, 3-, 9-, 15-, 70-years) using digital elevation models (DEMs), mainly created from satellite data. Our results show that the long-term extrusion rate at Bagana, measured over years to decades, has remained at about 1.0m3s−1. We present models of the total edifice volume, and show that, if our measured extrusion rates are representative, the volcano could have been built in only {\textasciitilde}300years. It could also possibly have been built at a slower rate during a longer, earlier period of growth. Six kilometres NNW of Bagana, an andesite-dacite volcano, Billy Mitchell, had a large, caldera-forming plinian eruption 437years ago. We consider the possibility that, as a result of this eruption, the magma supply was diverted from Billy Mitchell to Bagana. It seems that Bagana is a rare example of a very youthful, polygenetic, andesite volcano. The characteristics of such a volcano, based on the example of Bagana, are: a preponderance of lava products over pyroclastic products, a high rate of lava extrusion maintained for decades, a very high rate of SO2 emission, evidence of magma batch fractionation and location in a trans-tensional setting at the end of an arc segment above a very steeply dipping and rapidly converging subduction zone.},

	abstract = {The global carbon dioxide (CO2) flux from subaerial volcanoes remains poorly quantified, limiting our understanding of the deep carbon cycle during geologic time and in modern Earth. Past attempts to extrapolate the global volcanic CO2 flux have been biased by observations being available for a relatively small number of accessible volcanoes. Here, we propose that the strong, but yet unmeasured, CO2 emissions from several remote degassing volcanoes worldwide can be predicted using regional/global relationships between the CO2/ST ratio of volcanic gases and whole-rock trace element compositions (e.g., Ba/La). From these globally linked gas/rock compositions, we predict the CO2/ST gas ratio of 34 top-degassing remote volcanoes with no available gas measurements. By scaling to volcanic SO2 fluxes from a global catalogue, we estimate a cumulative “unmeasured” CO2 output of 11.4 ± 1.1 Mt/yr (or 0.26 ± 0.02·1012 mol/yr). In combination with the measured CO2 output of 27.4 ± 3.6 Mt/yr (or 0.62 ± 0.08·1012 mol/yr), our results constrain the time-averaged (2005–2015) cumulative CO2 flux from the Earth’s 91 most actively degassing subaerial volcanoes at 38.7 ± 2.9 Mt/yr (or 0.88 ± 0.06·1012 mol/yr).},

	abstract = {Bagana, arguably the most active volcano in Papua New Guinea, has been in a state of near-continuous eruption for over 150 years, with activity dominated by sluggish extrusion of thick blocky lava flows. If current extrusion rates are representative, the entire edifice may have been constructed in only 300-500 years. Bagana exhibits a remarkably high gas flux to the atmosphere, with persistent sulfur dioxide (SO\$\_2\$) emissions of several thousand tonnes per day. We have used satellite observations of SO\$\_2\$ emissions and thermal infrared radiant flux to explore the coupling of lava extrusion and gas emission at Bagana. The highest gas emissions (up to 10 kt/day) occur during co-extrusive intervals, suggesting a degree of coupling between lava and gas, but gas emissions remain relatively high (\${\textbackslash}sim\$2500 t/d) during inter-eruptive pauses. These passive emissions, which clearly persist for decades if not centuries, require a large volume of degassing but non-erupting magma beneath the volcano with a substantial exsolved volatile phase to feed the remarkable SO\$\_2\$ outgassing. The ability of this volatile phase to ascend freely to the surface is likely to be key to Bagana's largely effusive style of activity.},

It is also a required input for atmospheric chemistry and climate models, since it impacts the tropospheric burden of sulfate aerosol, a major climate-forcing species. Despite its significance, an inventory of passive volcanic degassing is very difficult to produce, due largely to the patchy spatial and temporal coverage of ground-based SO2 measurements. We report here the first volcanic SO2 emissions inventory derived from global, coincident satellite measurements, made by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA’s Aura satellite in 2005–2015. The OMI measurements permit estimation of SO2 emissions from over 90 volcanoes, including new constraints on fluxes from Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the Aleutian Islands, the Kuril Islands and Kamchatka. On average over the past decade, the volcanic SO2 sources consistently detected from space have discharged a total of {\textasciitilde}63 kt/day SO2 during passive degassing, or {\textasciitilde}23 ± 2 Tg/yr. We find that {\textasciitilde}30\% of the sources show significant decadal trends in SO2 emissions, with positive trends observed at multiple volcanoes in some regions including Vanuatu, southern Japan, Peru and Chile.},

The relative abundance of carbon and sulfur in volcanic gas as well as the total sulfur dioxide emission rate from a volcanic vent are established parameters in current volcano-monitoring strategies, and they oftentimes allow insights into subsurface processes. However, chemical reactions involving halogens are thought to have local to regional impact on the atmospheric chemistry around passively degassing volcanoes. In this study we demonstrate the successful deployment of a multirotor UAV (quadcopter) system with custom-made lightweight payloads for the compositional analysis and gas flux estimation of volcanic plumes. The various applications and their potential are presented and discussed in example studies at three volcanoes encompassing flight heights of 450 to 3300\&thinsp;m and various states of volcanic activity. Field applications were performed at Stromboli volcano (Italy), Turrialba volcano (Costa Rica) and Masaya volcano (Nicaragua).

We employed a series of miniaturized drone-mounted instrumentation including a mini-DOAS, two MultiGAS instruments, and an optical particle counter, supplemented by ground-based measurements. Payloads were typically 1–1.5 kg and flight times were 10–15 min. The measurements were both accurate and precise due to the inherent sensitivity of the instrumentation and the high gas concentrations, which the drones were able to sample. The quality of data obtained by our drones was comparable to that obtained by our ground-based measurements. At Turrialba in April 2017, we measured an average SO2 flux of 1,380 ± 280 T/day, CO2/SO2 of 6.5, and H2O/SO2 of 27.8. Using these values, we calculated a CO2 flux of 6,170 T/day and an H2O flux of 10,790 T/day. At Masaya in May 2017, the average SO2 flux was 1,560 ± 180 T/day, with CO2/SO2 of 3.9 and H2O/SO2 of 62.3, giving a mean CO2 flux of 4,150 T/day and mean H2O flux of 27,330 T/day. The elevated carbon and water fluxes and ratios are indicative of underlying magmas that are enriched in these components, resulting in the high levels of activity observed.},

	abstract = {Airborne measurements of volcanic gas composition using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Cessna aircraft were conducted at Kuchinoerabujima volcano, Japan, between 2014 and 2016. Because eruptions occurred in August 2014, May 2015, and June 2015, access to the summit crater was limited because of the risk of sudden eruption such that airborne measurements were the only viable method to measure the volcanic gas composition. Multi-GAS and alkali-filter pack measurements were made on the leeward side of the crater and around the crater, using the Cessna and UAV, respectively. Observations using the UAV could measure the dense plume and quantify the gas species of H2O, CO2, SO2, H2S, H2, HCl, and HF, while the observations using the Cessna could measure only the diluted plume and quantify CO2, SO2, H2S, and H2. The seven airborne observations enabled us to monitor variations in the volcanic gas composition. Over the observation period, the SO2/H2S ratio decreased from 10 to 1.9. The H2O/SO2 ratio, H2/SO2 ratio, and apparent equilibrium temperatures (AET) estimated using the volcanic gas composition increased after the 2014 eruption. The decrease in the SO2/H2S ratio might be attributed to changes in the pressure of degassing magma and interactions with the hydrothermal system. The airborne methods presented here highlight the utility of using light aircrafts to safely conduct volcanic gas measurements during periods of volcanic unrest when traditional ground-based methods are not possible.},

	abstract = {Volcanic gas emissions are intimately linked to the dynamics of magma ascent and outgassing and, on geological time scales, constitute an important source of volatiles to the Earth's atmosphere. Measurements of gas composition and flux are therefore critical to both volcano monitoring and to determining the contribution of volcanoes to global geochemical cycles. However, significant gaps remain in our global inventories of volcanic emissions, (particularly for CO2, which requires proximal sampling of a concentrated plume) for those volcanoes where the near-vent region is hazardous or inaccessible. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) provide a robust and effective solution to proximal sampling of dense volcanic plumes in extreme volcanic environments. Here we present gas compositional data acquired using a gas sensor payload aboard a UAS flown at Volcán Villarrica, Chile. We compare UAS-derived gas time series to simultaneous crater rim multi-GAS data and UV camera imagery to investigate early plume evolution. SO2 concentrations measured in the young proximal plume exhibit periodic variations that are well correlated with the concentrations of other species. By combining molar gas ratios (CO2/SO2 = 1.48–1.68, H2O/SO2 = 67–75, and H2O/CO2 = 45–51) with the SO2 flux (142 ± 17 t/day) from UV camera images, we derive CO2 and H2O fluxes of 150 t/day and 2,850 t/day, respectively. We observe good agreement between time-averaged molar gas ratios obtained from simultaneous UAS- and ground-based multi-GAS acquisitions. However, the UAS measurements made in the young, less diluted plume reveal additional short-term periodic structure that reflects active degassing through discrete, audible gas exhalations.},

The gas analyzer was used to acquire about 3000 determinations over the fumarolic field, allowing the definition of its chemical structure and heterogeneity. Our high-resolution analysis reveals that, in December 2004, the La Fossa fumarolic field was characterized by an oxidized inner core (SO2/H2S ratios of ∼3), and by more reducing conditions on its northern edge (SO2/H2S ratios of ∼1; range: 0.2–3.3). CO2/(SO2+H2S) molar ratios averaged 35 ± 21, with overlapping compositions for rim and inner crater fumaroles. S-poor compositions (CO2/(SO2+H2S) ≥ 50) characterized the field margins, probably due to deposition of native sulfur. Based on the above data and an SO2 flux of 18 ± 3 t·d−1, we estimate CO2 and H2S output rates from the volcano of 420 ± 250 and 4 ± 2 t·d−1, respectively.},

SO2 flux was determined by routine DOAS traverse measurements, while H2O and CO2 were evaluated by scaling MultiGAS-sensed H2O/SO2 and CO2/SO2 plume ratios to the UV-sensed SO2 flux. The time-averaged TV flux from Etna is evaluated at ∼21,000 t·day−1, with a large fraction accounted for by H2O (∼13,000 t·day−1). H2O dominates (≥70\%) the volatile budget during syn-eruptive degassing, while CO2 and H2O contribute equally to the TV flux during passive degassing. The CO2 flux was observed to be particularly high prior to the 2006 eruption, suggesting that this parameter is a good candidate for eruption prediction at basaltic volcanoes.},

The multi-sensor system consists of a humidity–temperature sensor, SO2 electrochemical sensor, CO2 IR analyzer, pump and flow control units, pressure sensor, data logger, and batteries; the whole system is light (∼5 kg) and small enough to carry in a medium-size backpack. Volcanic plume is a mixture of atmosphere and volcanic gas; therefore volcanic gas composition and temperature can be estimated by subtracting the atmospheric gas background from the plume data. In order to obtain the contrasting data of the plume and the atmosphere, measurements were repeated in and out of the plume. The multi-sensor technique was applied to measure the plume of Tarumae, Tokachi, and Meakan volcanoes, Hokkaido, Japan. Repeated measurements at each volcano gave a consistent composition with ±10–30\% errors, depending on the stability of the background atmospheric conditions. Fumarolic gas samples were also collected at the Tokachi volcano by a conventional method, and we found a good agreement (the difference {\textless}10\%) between the composition estimated by the multi-sensor technique and conventional method. Those results demonstrated that concentration ratios of major volcanic gas species (i.e., H2O, CO2, and SO2) and temperature can be estimated by the new technique without any complicated chemical analyses even for gases emitted from an inaccessible open vent. Estimation of a more detailed gas composition can be also achieved by the combination of alkaline filter techniques to measure Cl/F/S ratios in the plume and other sensors for H2S and H2.},

	abstract = {Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is monitored using ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectroscopy at numerous volcanoes around the world due to its importance as a measure of volcanic activity and a tracer for other gaseous species. Recent studies have shown that failure to take realistic radiative transfer into account during the spectral retrieval of the collected data often leads to large errors in the calculated emission rates. Here, the framework for a new evaluation method which couples a radiative transfer model to the spectral retrieval is described. In it, absorption spectra are simulated, and atmospheric parameters are iteratively updated in the model until a best match to the measurement data is achieved. The evaluation algorithm is applied to two example Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) measurements conducted at Kīlauea volcano (Hawaii). The resulting emission rates were 20 and 90\% higher than those obtained with a conventional DOAS retrieval performed between 305 and 315 nm, respectively, depending on the different SO2 and aerosol loads present in the volcanic plume. The internal consistency of the method was validated by measuring and modeling SO2absorption features in a separate wavelength region around 375 nm and comparing the results. Although additional information about the measurement geometry and atmospheric conditions is needed in addition to the acquired spectral data, this method for the first time provides a means of taking realistic three-dimensional radiative transfer into account when analyzing UV-spectral absorption measurements of volcanic SO2 plumes.},

	abstract = {We report here the first results from an automated, telemetered UV scanning spectrometer system for monitoring SO2 emission rates at Soufrière Hills Volcano, Montserrat. Two spectrometers receive light by way of a motor-driven stepping prism and telescope in order to make vertical scans of the volcanic plume. Spectral data from these spectrometers, situated 2,800 m apart and 4,500 m from the volcano, are relayed back to the observatory every 4–5 s via radio modems. A full scan of the plume is accomplished every 1–6 min by the (time-synchronised) spectrometers and a SO2 emission rate is calculated using the SO2 slant concentrations, scan angles and plume speeds estimated from the wind speed from a telemetered weather station near to the volcano. The plume's position and dimensions are calculated using the angular data from the two spectrometers. The plume height varies significantly diurnally and seasonally and is important in order to minimise the error on SO2 emission rates. The new scanning system (Scanspec) provides SO2 emission rates from 08:00 to 16:00 h local time every day. Preliminary results highlight a number of features of the SO2 time series and plume dynamics and give our first indications of the errors and limits of detection of this system. SO2 emission rates vary widely on all time scales (minutes, days, months). This new system has already provided the first real and consistent indication that SO2 emission rates vary on a minutes to hours basis, which can be correlated with volcanic activity (for example, rockfall and pyroclastic flow activity). It is anticipated that this system at Soufrière Hills will yield information on shallow processes occurring on short time scales (periods of minutes to hours) as well as deep processes relating to magma supply rates, which will be associated with longer wavelength SO2 signals of weeks to months.},

	abstract = {This work presents a new database of SO2 and CO2 fluxes from the Southern Central American Volcanic Arc (SCAVA) for the period 2015–2016. We report ∼300 SO2 flux measurements from 10 volcanoes and gas ratios from 11 volcanoes in Costa Rica and Nicaragua representing the most extensive available assessment of this ∼500 km arc segment. The SO2 flux from SCAVA is estimated at 6,240 ± 1,150 T/d, about a factor of three higher than previous estimations (1972–2013). We attribute this increase in part to our more complete assessment of the arc. Another consideration in interpreting the difference is the context of increased volcanic activity, as there were more eruptions in 2015–2016 than in any period since ∼1980. A potential explanation for increased degassing and volcanic activity is a change in crustal stress regime (from compression to extension, opening volcanic conduits) following two large (Mw {\textgreater} 7) earthquakes in the region in 2012. The CO2 flux from the arc is estimated at 22,500 ± 4,900 T/d, which is equal to or greater than estimates of C input into the SCAVA subduction zone. Time-series data sets for arc degassing need to be improved in temporal and spatial coverage to robustly constrain volatile budgets and tectonic controls. Arc volatile budgets are strongly influenced by short-lived degassing events and arc systems likely display significant short-term variations in volatile output, calling for expansion of nascent geochemical monitoring networks to achieve spatial and temporal coverage similar to traditional geophysical networks.},

	abstract = {Calderas are among the most active and dangerous volcanoes. Caldera unrest is defined by enhanced seismicity, gravity changes, surface deformation, and degassing. Although much caldera unrest does not lead to an eruption, every eruption is preceded by an unrest episode. Therefore, the proper description of unrest and the forecast of its possible outcome is a timely and challenging task. Here we review the best known unrest at calderas from 1988 to 2014, building on previous work and proposing an updated database. Where established, the root cause for unrest is always magmatic; none was purely hydrothermal or tectonic. An interpretive classification of unrest invokes two spectra—compositional (mafic to felsic) and the state of magma conduits feeding from the magma reservoir(s) to the surface (from fully plugged, through semiplugged, to open). Magma and gas in open conduits can rise and erupt freely; magma in semiplugged conduits erupts less frequently yet still allows some gas to escape; plugged conduits allow neither magma nor gas to escape. Unrest in mafic calderas is subtler, less pronounced, and repeated, especially with open systems, ensuring the continuous, aseismic, and moderate release of magma. Plugged felsic calderas erupt infrequently, anticipated by isolated, short and seismically active unrest. Semiplugged felsic calderas also erupt infrequently and are restless over decades or centuries, with uplift, seismicity, and degassing and, on the longer-term, resurgence, suggesting repeated stalled intrusions. Finally, the expected advances in better understanding caldera unrest are discussed.},

	abstract = {Volcanoes are the main pathway to the surface for volatiles that are stored within the Earth. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is of particular interest because of its potential for climate forcing. Understanding the balance of CO2 that is transferred from the Earth’s surface to the Earth’s interior, hinges on accurate quantification of the long-term emissions of volcanic CO2 to the atmosphere. Here we present an updated evaluation of the world’s volcanic CO2 emissions that takes advantage of recent improvements in satellite-based monitoring of sulfur dioxide, the establishment of ground-based networks for semi-continuous CO2-SO2 gas sensing and a new approach to estimate key volcanic gas parameters based on magma compositions. Our results reveal a global volcanic CO2 flux of 51.3 ± 5.7 Tg CO2/y (11.7 × 1011 mol CO2/y) for non-eruptive degassing and 1.8 ± 0.9 Tg/y for eruptive degassing during the period from 2005 to 2015. While lower than recent estimates, this global volcanic flux implies that a significant proportion of the surface-derived CO2 subducted into the Earth’s mantle is either stored below the arc crust, is efficiently consumed by microbial activity before entering the deeper parts of the subduction system, or becomes recycled into the deep mantle to potentially form diamonds.},

	abstract = {Helium, neon and argon isotope ratios have been analysed from phenocrysts of eleven lava samples belonging to the last eruptive cycle of Mount Vesuvius (1631 until 1944). The phenocrysts separates include pyroxene (N=10) and olivine (N=1). All phenocryst samples show similarly low gas contents (He, Ne and Ar ∼10−10 cm3/g). 3He/4He ratios, 5.3–2.11 Ra, are generally low if compared to those typical of the MORB and those of the European Subcontinental Mantle (ESCM), respectively R/Ra 8.5±1 and 6.0–6.5. A decreasing trend is found from 1631 to 1796, while a more homogeneous set of data is obtained for more recent eruptions, as evidenced by an average R/Ra value of 2.85. Neon ratios (21Ne/22Ne and 20Ne/22Ne) strongly differ from those typically found on volcanoes and suggest that a crustal component has been added in the source region to Mt. Vesuvius magmas. Argon ratios (40Ar/36Ar and 38Ar/36Ar) have values similar to the atmosphere and are well correlated. The low 40Ar/36Ar ratio (max. 302) is, however, in the range of the 40Ar/36Ar ratios obtained from several lava samples at other Italian volcanoes and might be considered to have a deep origin. Two hypothesis have been discussed: (1) a deep argon-like-air source, due to subduction of air-rich sediments and/or (2) a preferential loss of Ar, in comparison to lighter noble gases, from silicic melts. Helium isotopic analysis of gas samples recently collected from crater and submarine fumaroles are similar to those of lavas belonging to the final part of this eruptive cycle. This result supports the idea that no new juvenile fluids from the source region have been injected into the magmatic reservoir during the 1631–1944 eruptive cycle and, more importantly, until 1993. Both sets of data help to understand the genesis of these fluids and to constrain the current activity of the volcano.},

Some pyroxene phenocrysts have suffered post-eruptive modification, either by less than 1\% assimilation of crustal-derived He, or by closed-system ageing of He. Olivine phenocrysts record mantle source 3He/4He compositions, with the average 3He/4He for La Palma olivine (7.6±0.8RA, where RA is the atmospheric 3He/4He ratio of 1.38×10−6) being within uncertainty of those for El Hierro (7.7±0.3RA), and the canonical mid-ocean ridge basalt range (MORB: 8±1RA). The new helium isotope data for El Hierro and La Palma show no distinct correlations with whole-rock 87Sr/86Sr, 143Nd/144Nd, 187Os/188Os, or Pb isotopes, but 3He/4He ratios for La Palma lavas correlate with 18O/16O measured for the same phenocryst populations. Despite limited 3He/4He variations for El Hierro and La Palma, their He–O isotope systematics are consistent with derivation from mantle sources containing distinct recycled oceanic basaltic crust (El Hierro) and gabbroic lithosphere (La Palma) components that have mixed with depleted mantle, and a high-3He/4He component ({\textgreater}9.7RA) in the case of La Palma. The new data are consistent with models involving generation of compositionally and lithologically (e.g., pyroxenite, eclogite, peridotite) heterogeneous mantle sources containing recycled oceanic crust and lithosphere entrained within upwelling high-3He/4He mantle that has been severely diluted by interaction with depleted mantle. We propose that the noble gas systematics of HIMU-type lavas and ocean island basalts (OIB) in general, are most simply interpreted as being controlled by the most gas-rich reservoir involved in mixing to generate their mantle sources. In this scenario, HIMU and enriched mantle (EM) sources are dominated by depleted mantle, or high-3He/4He mantle, because recycled crust and lithosphere have low He concentrations. Consequently, high-3He/4He OIB would predominantly reflect derivation from a less depleted mantle source with sub-equal to higher He contents than depleted mantle. The available coupled He–O isotope systematics measured for OIB lavas are consistent with this hypothesis.},

	abstract = {San Cristóbal volcano in northwest Nicaragua is one of the most active basaltic–andesitic stratovolcanoes of the Central American Volcanic Arc (CAVA). Here we provide novel constraints on the volcano's magmatic plumbing system, by presenting the first direct measurements of major volatile contents in mafic-to-intermediate glass inclusions from Holocene and historic-present volcanic activity. Olivine-hosted (forsterite [Fo] {\textless}80; Fo{\textless}80) glass inclusions from Holocene tephra layers contain moderate amounts of H2O (0.1–3.3wt\%) and S and Cl up to 2500μg/g, and define the mafic (basaltic) endmember component. Historic-present scoriae and tephra layers exhibit more-evolved olivines (Fo69–72) that contain distinctly lower volatile contents (0.1–2.2wt\% H2O, 760–1675μg/gS, and 1021–1970μg/g Cl), and represent a more-evolved basaltic–andesitic magma. All glass inclusions are relatively poor in CO2, with contents reaching 527μg/g (as measured by nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry), suggesting pre- to postentrapment CO2 loss to a magmatic vapor. We use results of Raman spectroscopy obtained in a population of small ({\textless}50μm) inclusions with CO2-bearing shrinkage bubbles (3–12μm) to correct for postentrapment CO2 loss to bubbles, and to estimate the original minimum CO2 content in San Cristóbal parental melts at {\textasciitilde}1889μg/g, which is consistent with the less-CO2-degassed melt inclusions (MI) ({\textgreater}1500μg/g) found in Nicaragua at Cerro Negro, Nejapa, and Granada. Models of H2O and CO2 solubilities constrain the degassing pathway of magmas up to 425MPa ({\textasciitilde}16km depth), which includes a deep CO2 degassing step (only partially preserved in the MI record), followed by coupled degassing of H2O and S plus crystal fractionation at magma volatile saturation pressures from ∼195 to {\textless}10MPa. The variation in volatile contents from San Cristóbal MI is interpreted to reflect (1) Holocene eruptive cycles characterized by the rapid emplacement of basaltic magma batches, saturated in volatiles, at depths of 3.8–7.4km, and (2) the ascent of more-differentiated and cogenetic volatile-poor basaltic andesites during historic-present eruptions, having longer residence times in the shallowest ({\textless}3.4km) and hence coolest regions of the magmatic plumbing system. We also report the first measurements of the compositions of noble-gas isotopes (He, Ne, and Ar) in fluid inclusions in olivine and pyroxene crystals. While the measured 40Ar/36Ar ratios (300–304) and 4He/20Ne ratios (9–373) indicate some degree of air contamination, the 3He/4He ratios (7.01–7.20Ra) support a common mantle source for Holocene basalts and historic-present basaltic andesites. The magmatic source is interpreted as generated by a primitive MORB-like mantle, that is influenced to variable extents by distinct slab fluid components for basalts (Ba/La{\textasciitilde}76 and U/Th{\textasciitilde}0.8) and basaltic andesites (Ba/La{\textasciitilde}86 and U/Th{\textasciitilde}1.0) in addition to effects of magma differentiation. These values for the geochemical markers are particularly high, and their correlation with strong plume CO2/S ratios from San Cristóbal is highly consistent with volatile recycling at the CAVA subduction zone, where sediment involvement in mantle fluids influences the typical relatively C-rich signature of volcanic gases in Nicaragua.},

	abstract = {We report new He abundance and isotope measurements of phenocryst phases in volcanic tephra and lavas from the Nicaragua-Costa Rica section of the Central American arc, where significant variations in crustal thickness have been inferred. Helium isotope values range from 4.6RA to 7.5RA, with no evidence for crustal thickness influencing measured 3He/4He ratios. A comparison of He abundances and isotopes measured in mafic phenocrysts from tephra vs. lavas from two separate eruptions at Cerro Negro show that both sampling media preserve phenocrysts with high 3He/4He values. 3He/4He ratios measured in phenocryst phases show good agreement with He isotope values of geothermal fluids from the same volcanoes. However, we note that the pyroxenes tend to have lower 3He/4He ratios (4.6–7.0RA) than the olivines (3He/4He=6.1–7.5RA) over a range of concentration values and are consistently lower in cogenetic phenocryst pairs at all locations sampled. In order to assess how this difference arises, we explore two alternative mechanisms: (1) diffusion-related isotopic fractionation, and (2) late-stage radiogenic 4He additions, preferentially influencing pyroxene grains. In the first case, we reject diffusion-related fractionation of He isotopes since lower 3He/4He ratios are not accompanied by a decrease in He concentration values. The second scenario is evaluated on the basis of Mg numbers in cogenetic phenocryst pairs and by petrological modeling of the crystallization sequence. Mg numbers and modeling results at low pressure conditions (=1 kbar) suggest that olivine crystallization preceded pyroxene crystallization. However, since lavas do not show evidence for extensive crustal contamination, we suggest that the best explanation for the lower 3He/4He ratios in pyroxenes is related to the closure temperatures of the phenocryst phases. Given its lower closure temperatures and higher He diffusion rates, we suggest that pyroxenes would be more susceptible to late-stage He exchange with a low 3He/4He source during ascent, presumably the surrounding crust.},

	abstract = {Turrialba volcano lies in the southern sector of the Central American Volcanic Front (CAVF) in Costa Rica. The geochemistry of major and trace elements, and Sr and Nd isotopes of a selected suite of volcanic rocks ranging in composition from basaltic andesite to dacite and belonging to the last 10ka of activity of Turrialba volcano is described, together with the He-, Ne-, and Ar-isotope compositions of fluid inclusions hosted in olivine and pyroxene crystals. Most of the variability in the rock chemistry is consistent with typical trends of fractional crystallization, but there is an outlying group of andesites that displays an adakite-like composition (with a consistent depletion in high-field-strength elements and a marked enrichment in Sr) and low 3He/4He ratios (7.0–7.2 Ra). The trace-element composition of these rocks is typical of subduction-related magmas influenced by an OIB-like component at the source associated with the subduction of the Galapagos seamounts. The 87Sr/86Sr (0.703612–0.703678) and 143Nd/144Nd (0.512960–0.512984) ratios of the bulk rocks vary within narrow ranges, and are among the least-radiogenic isotope signatures of the CAVF volcanoes. The 3He/4He ratios measured in fluid inclusions hosted in olivine crystals (up to 8.1 Ra) are among the highest for the CAVF, and indicate that radiogenic 4He from fluids derived from the subducting slab contribute negligibly to the mantle wedge. The difference in He isotopes between most of studied rocks and those showing adakite-like features reasonably reflects two distinct components in the local mantle: (1) a MORB-like component, characterized by the highest He-isotope ratios (7.8–8.1 Ra), and (2) an OIB-like component, characterized by lower He-isotope ratios (7.0–7.2 Ra), coming from the subduction of the Galapagos seamounts. An overview at the regional scale indicates that high He-isotope ratios are peculiar to the two extreme sectors of the CAVF (Costa Rica to the south and Guatemala to the north), whereas in the central sector (Nicaragua) the magma source is probably contaminated by slab fluids. For the past few years Turrialba volcano has been in a volcanic unrest phase that has included a series of explosions, the most recent of which occurred between October 2014 and May 2015. The volcano is subject to an ongoing safety alert due to the possibility of a magmatic eruption. One of the crucial questions to be addressed is the kind of eruption that can be expected, and hence what type of magma is likely to be involved. The high 3He/4He ratios (7.8–8.0 Ra) measured during 2011 at high-temperature fumaroles of Turrialba craters are comparable to those measured in fluid inclusions of basaltic andesites that erupted in 1864–1866, suggesting that the magma currently feeding the shallow plumbing system has similar geochemical characteristics to the most recently erupted magma.},

	abstract = {We present new He–Ne data for geothermal fluids and He–Ne–Ar data for basalts from throughout the Icelandic neovolcanic zones and older parts of the Icelandic crust. Geothermal fluids, subglacial glasses, and mafic phenocrysts are characterized by a wide range in helium isotope ratios (3He/4He) encompassing typical MORB-like ratios through values as high as 36.8 RA (where RA=air 3He/4He). Although neon in geothermal fluids is dominated by an atmospheric component, samples from the northwest peninsula show a small excess of nucleogenic 21Ne, likely produced in-situ and released to circulating fluids. In contrast, geothermal fluids from the neovolcanic zones show evidence of a contribution of mantle-derived neon, as indicated by 20Ne enrichments up to 3\% compared to air. The neon isotope composition of subglacial glasses reveals that mantle neon is derived from both depleted MORB-mantle and a primordial, ‘solar’ mantle component. However, binary mixing between these two endmembers can account for the He–Ne isotope characteristics of the basalts only if the 3He/22Ne ratio of the primordial mantle endmember is lower than in the MORB component. Indeed, the helium to neon elemental ratios (4He/21Ne∗ and 3He/22Nes where 21Ne∗=nucleogenic 21Ne and 22Nes=‘solar’-derived 22Ne) of the majority of Icelandic subglacial glasses are lower than theoretical values for Earth’s mantle, as observed previously for other OIB samples. Helium may be depleted relative to neon in high-3He/4He ratio parental melts due to either more compatible behavior during low-degree partial melting or more extensive diffusive loss relative to the heavier noble gases. However, Icelandic glasses show higher 4He/40Ar∗ (40Ar∗=radiogenic Ar) values for a given 4He/21Ne∗ value compared to the majority of other OIB samples: this observation is consistent with extensive open-system equilibrium degassing, likely promoted by lower confining pressures during subglacial eruptions of Icelandic lavas. Taken together, the He–Ne–Ar systematics of Icelandic subglacial glasses are imprinted with the overlapping effects of helium depletion in the high-3He/4He ratio parental melt, binary mixing of two distinct mantle components, degassing fractionation and interaction with atmospheric noble gases. However, it is still possible to discern differences in the noble gas characteristics of the Icelandic mantle source beneath the neovolcanic zones, with MORB-like He–Ne isotope features prevalent in the Northern Rift Zone and a sharp transition to more primitive ‘solar-like’ characteristics in central and southern Iceland.},

	abstract = {The major elements, trace elements and Sr and Nd isotopes of selected Etnean primitive rocks ({\textless}15kyBP) were studied in order to characterize their mantle source. The noble-gas geochemistry of fluid inclusions in minerals from the same lavas was also investigated. The major element compositions of whole rocks and minerals showed that these products are among the most primitive at Mt. Etna, comprising 6.3–17.5wt.\% MgO. The variable LREE (Light Rare Earth Elements) enrichment relative to MORB (Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalt) (Lan/Ybn=11–26), together with the patterns of certain trace-element ratios (i.e., Ce/Yb versus Zr/Nb and Th/Y versus La/Yb), can be attributed to varying degrees of melting of a common mantle source. Numerical simulations performed with the MELTS program allowed the melting percentages associated with each product to be estimated. This led us to recalculate the hypothetical parental trace-element content of the Etnean mantle source, which was common to all of the investigated rocks. The characteristics of the Sr, Nd and He isotopes confirmed the primitive nature of the rocks, with the most-depleted and primitive lava being that of Mt. Spagnolo (SPA; 143Nd/144Nd=0.512908 87Sr/86Sr=0.703317–0.703325 and 3He/4He=7.6 Ra), and highlighted the similarity of the mantle sources feeding the volcanic activity of Mt. Etna and the Hyblean Plateau (a region to the south of Mt. Etna and characterized by older magmatism than Mt. Etna). The coupling of noble gases and trace elements suggests an origin for the investigated Etnean lavas from melting of a Hyblean-like mantle, consisting of a two-component source where a peridotitic matrix is veined by 10\% pyroxenite. A variable degree of mantle contamination by crustal-like fluids, probably related to subduction, is proposed to explain the higher Sr-isotope and lower Nd-isotope values in some rocks (143Nd/144Nd up to 0.512865 and 87Sr/86Sr up to 0.703707). This process probably occurred in the source prior to magma generation, refertilizing some portions of the mantle. Accordingly, the estimated degree of melting responsible for each magma appears to be related to its 87Sr/86Sr enrichment. In contrast, the decoupling between 3He/4He and 87Sr/86Sr ratios requires the occurrence in the crustal reservoirs of further processes capable of shifting the He isotope ratio towards slightly more radiogenic values, such as magma aging or a contribution of shallow fluid. Therefore, different residence times in the Etnean reservoir and/or various rates of magma ascent could be key parameters for preserving the original He isotope marker of the Etnean mantle source.},

	abstract = {The 2001 and 2002–2003 flank eruptions of Mt. Etna consisted of near continuous explosive activity and sporadic lava flows. Previous studies have suggested that distinct magmas were simultaneously tapped by fissures in different parts of the volcano, indicating a complex plumbing system. From textural and chemical data it has been suggested that “eccentric” eruptions on the south flank were fed by a deep-seated reservoir that is not related to the central conduit. In contrast, materials erupted above 2600m and from the northeast flank represent partially degassed, more fractionated magma, typical of that residing within the central vents. A concern is that Etna has entered a new phase of activity, with magma supply from a deep reservoir that is capable of generating recurrent flank eruptions posing significant hazard to populated areas and air travel. We have investigated materials that erupted from different vents during both the 2001 and 2002/3 eruptive episodes by means of petrology, whole-rock chemistry and helium isotopic methods. Here we show from trace element chemistry and the 3He/4He isotope record of melt inclusions in olivine that the mantle source for both magma batches is identical. Furthermore, this magmatic source has not changed over the past 0.5Ma. As such, our data support the premise that the petrological variability exhibited by products that erupted from different parts of the volcano reflects storage, fractionation and degassing at different levels within the crust.},

These cumulates, erupted about 2ka ago at Stromboli volcano (Italy), have been already investigated by Martelli et al. (2014) mainly for Sr-Nd isotopes and for their noble gases geochemistry. The concentration of CO2 varies of one order of magnitude from 3.8·10−8molg−1 to 4.8·10−7molg−1, with δ13C values between −2.8‰ and −1.5‰ vs V-PDB. These values overlap the range of measurements performed in the crater gases emitted at Stromboli (−2.5‰{\textless}δ13CCO2{\textless}−1.0‰). Since SBX formed from relatively primitive mantle-derived basic magmas, we argue that the isotope composition displayed by fluid inclusions and surface gases can be considered representative of the magma volatile imprinting released by partial melting of the mantle source beneath Stromboli (−2.8‰{\textless}δ13C{\textless}−1.0‰). In addition, the δ13C signature of CO2 is not significantly modified by fractionation due to magmatic degassing or intracrustal contamination processes owing to magma ascent and residence within the volcano plumbing system. Such δ13C values are higher than those commonly reported for MORB-like upper mantle (−8÷−4‰) and likely reflect the source contamination of the local mantle wedge by CO2 coming from the decarbonation of the sediments carried by the subducting Ionian slab with a contribution of organic carbon up to 7\%.},

	abstract = {We report on the variation of the elemental (He, Ne, and Ar) and isotopic (He and Ar) compositions of olivine- and clinopyroxene-hosted fluid inclusions hosted in lavas, pyroclastics, and cumulate xenoliths from the last 60ka of the eruptive history of Stromboli volcano, Italy. Samples belong to (i) the present-day activity as represented by shoshonitic (SHO) basalts, i.e., pumices with low porphyritic (LP) content and high porphyritic (HP) scoriae; (ii) the subalkaline versus alkaline products erupted at Stromboli during its subaerial history among the extreme magmatic series, i.e., calc-alkaline (CA) and potassic (KS); and (iii) the only known ultramafic cumulates (San Bartolo wehrlite xenoliths, SBX) outcropping in the island, carried to the surface by recent (ca. 2ka) basaltic lava. To interpret the results better, we also investigated trace elements in the clinopyroxenes of wehrlite xenoliths and the Sr and Nd isotopes of all of the products in which the 3He/4He ratio was measured. Wehrlite xenoliths are igneous cumulates crystallized at mantle depth that mostly consist of clinopyroxene and olivine crystals with limited compositional variation. The texture, mineral chemistry, pattern of trace elements and Sr–Nd-isotope ratios (in clinopyroxene) suggest that these cumulates were produced by the early crystallization of a primitive basaltic magma with CA or HKCA–SHO affinity. The gas contents measured in the mafic crystals decrease from the wehrlite xenoliths through LP pumice, CA and KS lavas and, finally, to the HP scoria. This observation is consistent with crystallization and fluid entrapment from mantle depths to progressively shallower crustal levels. The low gas content extracted from the HP crystals did not allow measurement of their 3He/4He ratios. Most of the investigated crystals exhibit a 3He/4He ratio in the range of 4.0–4.9 Ra, with only the KS mafic minerals exhibiting lower 3He/4He values (≤3.5 Ra). The low values of He-isotope ratios relative to those of the most-uncontaminated mantle source of the Aeolian lavas (i.e., 3He/4He {\textasciitilde}7 Ra at Alicudi) and in common volcanic arcs suggest that the Stromboli mantle wedge is more contaminated by sediments and aqueous fluids derived by the active subduction of the Ionian slab. We also hypothesize that a process of mantle He loss that occurred during the mantle metasomatism contributed to the decrease of 3He/4He. The low 3He/4He values of the KS minerals with respect to the other Stromboli magmatic series are consistent with the higher Sr- and lower Nd-isotope ratios measured in the same samples and are attributed to source heterogeneity. Finally, data for the 3He/4He ratios from mafic minerals were compared with those of currently emitted hydrothermal fluids, which are regularly sampled for volcano surveillance. The maximum 3He/4He ratio found in the hydrothermal fluids matched the maximum ratio measured in the LP fluid inclusions (i.e., 4.6 Ra) and thus corresponds to the upper limit that should be expected for surface gases during or before high-intensity eruptive events in which a deep gas component is released from the magma. These data also represent a reference for Stromboli volcanic surveillance.},

	abstract = {Helium isotope ratios of olivine and pyroxene phenocrysts from Plio-Quaternary volcanic rocks from southern Italy (seven Aeolian Islands, Mt. Vulture, Etna, Ustica, and Pantelleria) range from 2.3 to 7.1 Ra. Importantly, the phenocryst 3He/4He correlate well with whole rock Sr isotopic composition (0.70309–0.70711), reflecting the mixing of two sources. A significant contribution of He from crustal contamination is recorded only occasionally (e.g., pyroxenes from Vulcano). When merged with data from the Roman Comagmatic Province, a remarkably strong near-linear He-Sr isotope correlation is apparent. The general northward decrease in 3He/4He corresponds to an increase in 87Sr/86Sr (and a decrease in 143Nd/144Nd and 206Pb/204Pb) that is due to increasing metasomatic enrichment of the mantle wedge via subduction of the Ionian-Adriatic plate. Calculations based on the ingrowth of 4He in the wedge and on the 4He content of the subducting crust show that mechanisms of enrichment in radiogenic He are effective only if the wedge is strongly depleted in He relative to best estimates of the depleted mantle. This can be accommodated if the process of metasomatism by the subduction fluids depletes the mantle wedge. The 3He/4He of Pantelleria, Etna, Iblei, Ustica, Alicudi, and Filicudi basalts (7.0 ± 0.6 Ra) define the mantle composition least affected by subduction-related metasomatism. Although these volcanoes are from a variety of tectonic regimes (subduction-related, intraplate, rifting), their similarities suggest a common origin of geochemical features. Their characteristics are consistent with a HIMU-type mantle that either is younger than the Cook-Austral island end-member or has a lower 238U/204Pb.},

We investigated the ratios and abundances for noble-gas isotopes in fluid inclusions trapped in olivines and pyroxenes in the erupted products. We confirm that olivine has the most efficient crystalline structure for preserving the pristine composition of entrapped gases, while pyroxene can suffer diffusive He loss. Both the minerals also experience noble gas air contamination after eruption. Helium isotopes of the products genetically linked to the two different magmas fall in the isotopic range typical of the Etnean volcanism. This result is compatible with the metasomatic process that the Etnean mantle is undergoing by fluids from the Ionian slab during the last ten kyr, as previously inferred by isotope and trace element geochemistry. Significant differences were also observed among olivines of the same parental magma that erupted throughout 2001–2005, with 3He/4He ratios moving from about 7.0 Ra in 2001 volcanites, to 6.6 Ra in 2004–2005 products. Changes in He abundances and isotope ratios were attributed to variations in protracted degassing of the same magma bodies from the 2001 to the 2004–2005 events, with the latter lacking any contribution of undegassed magma. The decrease in 3He/4He is similar to that found from measurements carried out every fifteen days during the same period in gases discharged at the periphery of the volcano. To our knowledge this is the first time that such a comparison has been performed so in detail, and provides strong evidence of the real-time feeding of peripheral emissions by magmatic degassing.},

Regional differences in the depths of magma storage between volcanic arcs suggest that the settings of subduction zones and of overriding plates influence how magma ascends through the crust. Here we use a compilation of data for 70 volcanoes in 15 volcanic regions to better understand the geodynamic controls on magma storage. We describe the subduction system, which consists of the subducting slab, the mantle wedge, and the upper plate with 12 parameters encompassing the kinematics of the subduction, the structure and geometry of the slab, the timing of the subduction, the thermal structure of the slab, the upper-plate crustal structure, its stress regimes, and its thermal structure. We find that the magma reservoir depths correlate with the upper-plate crustal structure and with the stress regimes. Shallow reservoirs ({\textless}5 km depths) are 52\% more common in young Tertiary crust than in old Precambrian crust and 42\% more common in thin crust ({\textless}25 km) than in thick crust ({\textgreater}45 km). Similarly, shallow magma reservoirs are 33–69\% more common in extensional and strike-slip stress regimes that in compressional regimes. This illustrates the effect of buoyancy for magma ascent as well as the importance of stress regime and preexisting structures.},

Ash-rich particles dominate the volcanic cloud optical properties for the first 60 days. We also find that the initial SO2 lifetime is determined by SO2 uptake on ash, rather than by reaction with OH as commonly assumed. About 43\% more volcanic sulfur is removed from the stratosphere in 2 months with the SO2 heterogeneous chemistry on ash particles than without. This research suggests the need for re-evaluation of factors controlling SO2 lifetime in climate model simulations, and of the impact of volcanic ash on stratospheric chemistry and radiation.},

However, we currently have little way of knowing the size of the next eruption. Here, we focus on Rabaul Caldera, Papua New Guinea, to investigate differences between the magmatic processes that occurred prior to the {\textgreater}11-km3 caldera-forming “1400 BP” Rabaul Pyroclastics eruption and prior to subsequent, smaller ({\textless}1 km3) post-caldera eruptions. During the current, post-caldera phase, basaltic enclaves and mafic minerals are common among the erupted products, indicating basalt has been free to enter the mobile, dacite-dominated region of the sub-caldera plumbing system. Many of the post-caldera magmas are hybrid andesites, reflecting the importance of mixing and mingling of basaltic and dacitic magmas during this period. In contrast, before the Rabaul Pyroclastics eruption, the recharge was an andesite that was not the product of mixing basalt and dacite. The lack of basaltic recharge prior to the Rabaul Pyroclastics eruption suggests basalt was prevented from entering the shallow, sub-caldera magma system at that time, possibly by the presence of a large, silicic, melt-dominated body. That basalt can currently enter the shallow system is consistent with reduced thermal and rheological contrasts between the recharge and resident magma, implying a similar large silicic melt body currently does not exist beneath the caldera. If this hypothesis is correct, it may be possible to track the growth and evolution of large magma reservoirs that feed caldera-forming eruptions by monitoring the petrology of eruptive products.},

	abstract = {Lascar (5592 m a.s.l.) and Lastarria (5697 m a.s.l.) are Chilean active stratovolcanoes located in the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ; 16°S to 28°S) that have developed on top of a 71 km thick continental crust. Independently of the similarities in their Plinian/Vulcanian eruptive styles, their complex magmatic feeding structures and the origins of their magmatic fluids still necessitate constraints in order to improve the reliability of geochemical monitoring. Here we investigate the petrography, bulk-rock chemistry, and mineral chemistry in products from the 1986–1993 explosive eruptive cycle at Lascar and from several Holocene eruptive sequences at Lastarria. These data are integrated with measurements of the noble gas isotopes in fluid inclusions (FIs) of minerals from the same products as well as in fumarole gases. The geochemistry of minerals and rocks shows that the studied products belong to high-K–calc-alkaline series typical of subduction-related settings, and provide evidence of differentiation, mixing, and crustal assimilation that are higher at Lastarria. The contribution of slab sediments and fluids to magma genesis in the wedge is limited, suggesting a homogeneous mantle beneath CVZ. The deepest crystallization processes occurred at variable levels of the plumbing systems according to the lithostatic equivalent depths estimated with mineral equilibrium geobarometers at Lascar (15–29 km) and Lastarria ({\textasciitilde}20–40 km). The 40Ar/36Ar and 4He/20Ne ratios in FIs and fumarole gases indicate the presence of some degree of air contamination in the fluids from both volcanoes. The 3He/4He values at Lascar (6.9–7.3 Ra) are relatively homogeneous and comparable to those of fumaroles, suggesting a main zone of magma crystallization and degassing. In contrast, the 3He/4He values at Lastarria (5.31–8.01 Ra) vary over a wide range, suggesting various magma storage levels and providing evidence of crustal contamination, as indicated by the rock chemistry. We argue that mantle beneath the two volcanoes has a MORB-like signature of 3He/4He, while local crustal contamination explains the lower ratios measured at Lascar.},

	abstract = {The 2014–2015 Holuhraun eruption in Iceland, emitted ∼11 Tg of SO2 into the troposphere over 6 months, and caused one of the most intense and widespread volcanogenic air pollution events in centuries. This study provides a number of source terms for characterisation of plumes in large fissure eruptions, in Iceland and elsewhere. We characterised the chemistry of aerosol particle matter (PM) and gas in the Holuhraun plume, and its evolution as the plume dispersed, both via measurements and modelling. The plume was sampled at the eruptive vent, and in two populated areas in Iceland. The plume caused repeated air pollution events, exceeding hourly air quality standards (350 μg/m3) for SO2 on 88 occasions in Reykjahlíð town (100 km distance), and 34 occasions in Reykjavík capital area (250 km distance). Average daily concentration of volcanogenic PM sulphate exceeded 5 μg/m3 on 30 days in Reykjavík capital area, which is the maximum concentration measured during non-eruptive background interval. There are currently no established air quality standards for sulphate. Combining the results from direct sampling and dispersion modelling, we identified two types of plume impacting the downwind populated areas. The first type was characterised by high concentrations of both SO2 and S-bearing PM, with a high Sgas/SPM mass ratio (SO2(g)/SO42−(PM) {\textgreater} 10). The second type had a low Sgas/SPM ratio ({\textless}10). We suggest that this second type was a mature plume where sulphur had undergone significant gas-to-aerosol conversion in the atmosphere. Both types of plume were rich in fine aerosol (predominantly PM1 and PM2.5), sulphate (on average ∼90\% of the PM mass) and various trace species, including heavy metals. The fine size of the volcanic PM mass (75–80\% in PM2.5), and the high environmental lability of its chemical components have potential adverse implications for environmental and health impacts. However, only the dispersion of volcanic SO2 was forecast in public warnings and operationally monitored during the eruption. We make a recommendation that sulphur gas-to-aerosol conversion processes, and a sufficiently large model domain to contain the transport of a tropospheric plume on the timescale of days be utilized for public health and environmental impact forecasting in future eruptions in Iceland and elsewhere in the world.},

	abstract = {We report the first satellite-based survey of volcanic sulphur dioxide (SO2) degassing in Papua New Guinea, using Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) data. OMI is sensitive to low-level passive degassing. These observations are useful for volcano monitoring, hazard assessment (particularly aviation hazard) and assessment of arc geochemical budgets and are of immense value in remote regions with little ground-based instrumentation, such as Papua New Guinea. We identify Bagana, Manam, Rabaul, Ulawun and Langila as the active sources of volcanic SO2 in Papua New Guinea, with Bagana being the largest source. We present an OMI SO2 time series for 2005–2008 and a total detected regional output of ∼1.8 × 109 kg SO2. About 40\% of emissions were released by major eruption events at Manam (January 2005), Bagana (June 2006) and Rabaul (October 2006). Over the past century however, we estimate that major explosive eruptions contribute {\textless}5\% of the arc-scale SO2emission budget. Ground-based DOAS measurements of SO2 degassing at five of Papua New Guinea's volcanoes are compared with our OMI observations. The total OMI SO2 output is only ∼20\% of the total extrapolated from DOAS, a discrepancy which we demonstrate is consistent with other volcanic arcs. Therefore, the true total regional SO2 output may be considerably higher than that detected by OMI. Uncertainties in the OMI SO2data include the effects of in-plume chemical processing and dilution of SO2 prior to the satellite overpass, OMI's reduced sensitivity to low levels of SO2 in the planetary boundary layer and interference by meteorological clouds.},

Since late 2004, OMI has provided a high-quality SO2 dataset with near-continuous daily global coverage. In this review, we discuss the principal applications of this dataset to volcano monitoring: (1) the detection and tracking of large eruption clouds, primarily for aviation hazard mitigation; and (2) the use of OMI data for long-term monitoring of volcanic degassing. This latter application is relatively novel, and despite showing some promise, requires further study into a number of key uncertainties. We discuss these uncertainties, and illustrate their potential impact on volcano monitoring with OMI through four new case studies. We also discuss potential future avenues of research using OMI data, with a particular emphasis on the need for greater integration between various monitoring strategies, instruments and datasets.},

The atmospheric sulfur yields of eruptions are variable and not well correlated with eruption magnitude and for many eruptions the volume of erupted material is much greater than the subsurface volume change inferred from ground displacements. Up to now, these observations have been treated independently, but they are fundamentally linked. If magmas are vapour-saturated before eruption, bubbles cause the magma to become more compressible, resulting in muted ground displacements. The bubbles contain the sulfur-bearing vapour injected into the atmosphere during eruptions. Here we present a model that allows the inferred volume change of the reservoir and the sulfur mass loading to be predicted as a function of reservoir depth and the magma’s oxidation state and volatile content, which is consistent with the array of natural data.},

	abstract = {AbstractSatellite-measured SO2 mass loadings and ground-based measurements of SO2 emission rate are not directly comparable, with ∼40\% differences between mean emissions reported by each technique from Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador, during late 2007. Numerical simulations of postemission processing and dispersal of Tungurahua's SO2 emissions enable more effective comparison of ground- and satellite-based SO2 data sets, reducing the difference between them and constraining the impact of plume processing on satellite SO2 observations. Ground-based measurements of SO2 emission rate are used as the model input, and simulated SO2 mass loadings are compared to those measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). The changing extent of SO2 processing has a significant impact on daily variation in SO2 mass loading for a fixed volcanic emission rate. However, variations in emission rate at Tungurahua are large, suggesting that overall volcanic source strength and not subsequent processing is more likely to be the dominant control on atmospheric mass loading. SO2 emission rate estimates are derived directly from the OMI observations using modeled SO2 lifetime. Good agreement is achieved between both observed and simulated mass loadings (∼21\%) and satellite-derived and ground-measured SO2 emission rates (∼18\%), with a factor of 2 improvement over the differences found by simple direct comparison. While the balance of emission source strength and postemission processing will differ between volcanoes and regions, under good observation conditions and where SO2 lifetime is ∼24 hours, satellite-based sensors like OMI may provide daily observations of SO2 mass loading which are a good proxy for volcanic source strength.},

	abstract = {Owing to practical limitations less than half of Earth's 1400 subaerial volcanoes have no ground monitoring and few are monitored consistently. Earth-observing satellite missions provide global and frequent measurements of volcanic activity that are closing these gaps in coverage. We compare databases of global, satellite-detections of ground deformation (1992–2016), SO2 emissions (1978–2016), and thermal features (2000–2016) that together include 306 volcanoes. Each database has limitations in terms of spatial and temporal resolution but each technique contributed 45–86 unique detections of activity that were not detected by other techniques. Integration of these three databases shows that satellites detected {\textasciitilde}102 volcanic activities per year before the year 2000 and {\textasciitilde}103 activities per year after the year 2000. We find that most of the 54 erupting volcanoes without satellite-detections are associated with low volcano explosivity index eruptions and note that many of these eruptions (71\%, 97/135) occurred in the earliest decades of remote sensing (pre-2000) when detection thresholds were high. From 1978 to 2016 we conduct a preliminary analysis of the timing between the onset of satellite-detections of deformation (N = 154 episodes, N = 71 volcanoes), thermal features (N = 16,544 episodes, N = 99 volcanoes), and SO2 emissions (N = 1495 episodes, N = 116 volcanoes) to eruption start dates. We analyze these data in two ways: first, including all satellite-detected volcanic activities associated with an eruption; and second, by considering only the first satellite-detected activity related to eruption. In both scenarios, we find that deformation is dominantly pre-eruptive (47\% and 57\%) whereas available databases of thermal features and SO2 emissions utilizing mainly low-resolution sensors are dominantly co-eruptive (88\% and 76\% for thermal features, 97\% and 96\% for SO2 emissions).},

	abstract = {A major goal in volcanology is to be able to constrain the physical properties of a volcanic system using surface observations. The behaviour of a volcanic system following an eruption can provide powerful constraints on these properties and can provide valuable information for understanding future hazard. We use spatially and temporally dense observations of surface deformation following the 12 June 2011 eruption of Nabro (Eritrea) to place constraints on the mechanics of its subsurface volcanic system. Nabro was imaged 129 times by TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed satellites during a 15-month period following the eruption. We have produced a detailed time series of the line-of-sight (LOS) displacements at Nabro, finding that the volcano subsides during the entire observation period at a decaying rate. We found significant atmospheric artefacts remained in the data set after a standard spatio-temporal filter was applied. Applying an empirical correction using a linear phase-elevation relationship removed artefacts but also removed real topographically correlated deformation. Instead, we were able to correct each SAR acquisition using independent delay estimates derived from the ECMWF ERA-Interim (ERA-I) global atmospheric model. The corrected time series can be modelled with the deflation of a Mogi source at ∼ 6.4 ± 0.3 km depth. Modelling the time series using viscoelastic relaxation of a shell which surrounds a spherical magma chamber can explain the observed subsidence without a source of further volume loss if the magma is compressible. CO2 outgassing is also a possible cause of continued subsidence. Contraction due to cooling and crystallisation, however, is probably minor. If any post-eruptive recharge of the magmatic system at Nabro is occurring, the rate of recharge must be slower than the post-eruptive relaxation processes. Combined with the lack of pre-eruptive inflation, we suggest that recharge of the magmatic system at Nabro either occurs at a rate that is slower than our detection limit, or it occurs episodically. This case study demonstrates the power of long, dense geodetic time series at volcanoes.},

If current extrusion rates are representative, the entire edifice may have been constructed in only 300-500 years. Bagana exhibits a remarkably high gas flux to the atmosphere, with persistent sulfur dioxide (SO\$\_2\$) emissions of several thousand tonnes per day. We have used satellite observations of SO\$\_2\$ emissions and thermal infrared radiant flux to explore the coupling of lava extrusion and gas emission at Bagana. The highest gas emissions (up to 10 kt/day) occur during co-extrusive intervals, suggesting a degree of coupling between lava and gas, but gas emissions remain relatively high (\${\textbackslash}sim\$2500 t/d) during inter-eruptive pauses. These passive emissions, which clearly persist for decades if not centuries, require a large volume of degassing but non-erupting magma beneath the volcano with a substantial exsolved volatile phase to feed the remarkable SO\$\_2\$ outgassing. The ability of this volatile phase to ascend freely to the surface is likely to be key to Bagana's largely effusive style of activity.},

	abstract = {AbstractSatellite remote sensing enables continuous multiyear observations of volcanic activity in remote settings. Anatahan (Mariana Islands) is a remote volcano in the western North Pacific. Available ground-based measurements of sulphur dioxide (SO2) gas emissions at Anatahan place it among thelargest volcanic SO2 sources worldwide. These ground-based measurements, however, are restricted to eruptive intervals. Anatahan's activity since 2003 has been dominated temporally by prolonged periods of quiescence. Using 10 years of satellite observations from OMI, AIRS, SCIAMACHY, and GOME-2, we report highly variable SO2 emissions within and between eruptive and quiescent intervals at Anatahan. We find close correspondence between levels of activity reported at the volcano and levels of SO2 emissions detected from space. Eruptive SO2 emission rates have a mean value of ∼6400 t d−1, but frequently are in excess of 20,000 t d−1. Conversely, SO2 emissions during quiescent intervals are below the detection limit of space-based sensors and therefore are not likely to exceed ∼300 t d−1. We show that while Anatahan occupies a quiescent state for 85\% of the past 10 years, only ∼15\% of total SO2 emissions over this interval occur during quiescence, with the remaining ∼85\% released in short duration but intense syn-eruptive degassing. We propose that the integration of multiyear satellite data sets and activity histories are a powerful complement to targeted ground-based campaign measurements in better describing the long-term degassing behavior of remote volcanoes.},

	abstract = {The persistent open-vent activity of Mt. Etna volcano, in Sicily, is frequently punctuated by some of the most spectacular paroxysmal basaltic explosions in nature. Although magmatic gas is unquestionably the driver of these events, direct measurements of a paroxysm’s gas flux budget have remained challenging and limited in number, to date. A particularly violent paroxysmal sequence took place on Etna on December 2015, intermittently involving four of its summit craters, especially the Voragine (VOR) that had previously displayed no activity for several years. Here, we characterize the volcano’s SO2 degassing budget prior to, during and after this paroxysmal sequence, using ground-based (UV-Camera) and satellite (OMI) observations, complemented with thermal (thermal cameras and MODIS) measurements from both ground and space. We make use of the high spatial resolution of UV-cameras to resolve SO2 emissions from the erupting VOR crater for the first time, and to characterize temporal switches in degassing activity from VOR to the nearby New Southeast Crater (NSEC). Our data show that onset of paroxysmal activity on December 3-5 was marked by visible escalation in VOR SO2 fluxes (4700-8900 tons/day), in satellite-derived thermal emissions (2000 MW vs. {\textasciitilde}2-11 MW July-November 2015 average), and in OMI-derived daily SO2 masses (5.4±0.7 to 10.0±1.3 kilotonnes, kt; 0.5 kt was the average in the pre-eruptive period). Switch in volcanic activity from VOR to NSEC on December 6 was detected by increasing SO2 fluxes at the NSEC crater (up to 3460±350 tons/day), and by decaying SO2 emissions at VOR, until activity termination on December 19. Taken together, our observations infer the total degassed SO2 mass for the entire VOR paroxysmal sequence at 21,000±2730 t, corresponding to complete degassing of {\textasciitilde}1.9±0.3 Mm3 of magma, or significantly less than the measured erupted magma volumes (5.1-12 Mm3). From this mismatch, we propose that a sizeable fraction of the erupted magma during the paroxysms was stored and degassed in the volcano’s shallow plumbing system well before eruption.},

The use of ultraviolet satellite instruments for monitoring purposes has been assessed in numerous studies, but there are advantages to using infrared measurements, including that they can operate at night and during high-latitude winters. This study focuses on the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI). Retrievals developed for this instrument have been shown to be successful when applied to large eruptions, but little has been done to explore their potential for detecting and quantifying emissions from smaller and lower altitude emissions or for the assessment of ongoing activity. Here a “fast” linear retrieval has been applied across the globe to detect volcanic sources of SO2. The results are dominated by emissions from explosive eruptions, but signals are also evident from weak eruptions, passive degassing, and anthropogenic activity. Ecuador and Kamchatka were selected for further study with a more processing intensive iterative retrieval which can quantify the SO2 amount. At Tungurahua in Ecuador, good agreement was seen between IASI, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and ground-based flux data, demonstrating that the retrieval is capable of capturing relative changes in activity. Similarly, good agreement was found between IASI and OMI in Kamchatka. In this high-latitude region, OMI is unable to operate for 3 or 4 months in each year. It is therefore suggested that IASI could be used alongside other instruments for evaluating changes in volcanic activity.},

We have tested this idea by estimating the volumes of lava extruded over different time intervals (1-, 2-, 3-, 9-, 15-, 70-years) using digital elevation models (DEMs), mainly created from satellite data. Our results show that the long-term extrusion rate at Bagana, measured over years to decades, has remained at about 1.0m3s−1. We present models of the total edifice volume, and show that, if our measured extrusion rates are representative, the volcano could have been built in only {\textasciitilde}300years. It could also possibly have been built at a slower rate during a longer, earlier period of growth. Six kilometres NNW of Bagana, an andesite-dacite volcano, Billy Mitchell, had a large, caldera-forming plinian eruption 437years ago. We consider the possibility that, as a result of this eruption, the magma supply was diverted from Billy Mitchell to Bagana. It seems that Bagana is a rare example of a very youthful, polygenetic, andesite volcano. The characteristics of such a volcano, based on the example of Bagana, are: a preponderance of lava products over pyroclastic products, a high rate of lava extrusion maintained for decades, a very high rate of SO2 emission, evidence of magma batch fractionation and location in a trans-tensional setting at the end of an arc segment above a very steeply dipping and rapidly converging subduction zone.},
