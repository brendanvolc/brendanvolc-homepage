Here, we show that aerial measurements of volcanic gases using unoccupied aerial systems (UAS) transform our ability to measure and monitor plumes remotely and to constrain global volatile fluxes from volcanoes. Combining multi-scale measurements from ground-based remote sensing, long-range aerial sampling, and satellites, we present comprehensive gas fluxes—3760 ± [600, 310] tons day−1 CO2 and 5150 ± [730, 340] tons day−1 SO2—for a strong yet previously uncharacterized volcanic emitter: Manam, Papua New Guinea. The CO2/ST ratio of 1.07 ± 0.06 suggests a modest slab sediment contribution to the sub-arc mantle. We find that aerial strategies reduce uncertainties associated with ground-based remote sensing of SO2 flux and enable near–real-time measurements of plume chemistry and carbon isotope composition. Our data emphasize the need to account for time averaging of temporal variability in volcanic gas emissions in global flux estimates.","tags":[],"title":"Aerial strategies advance volcanic gas measurements at inaccessible, strongly degassing volcanoes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["BT McCormick Kilbride","K Mulina","G Wadge","RW Johnson","I Itikarai","M Edmonds"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1551139200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551139200,"objectID":"a3c3b66b4f392443a9afc9297a420039","permalink":"https://brendanvolc.github.io/publication/mccormick2019-bagana/","publishdate":"2019-02-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mccormick2019-bagana/","section":"publication","summary":"Bagana, arguably the most active volcano in Papua New Guinea, has been in a state of near-continuous eruption for over 150 years, with activity dominated by sluggish extrusion of thick blocky lava flows. If current extrusion rates are representative, the entire edifice may have been constructed in only 300–500 years. Bagana exhibits a remarkably high gas flux to the atmosphere, with persistent sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions of several thousand tons per day. This combination of apparent youth and high outgassing fluxes is considered unusual among persistently active volcanoes worldwide. We have used satellite observations of SO2 emissions and thermal infrared radiant flux to explore the coupling of lava extrusion and gas emission at Bagana. The highest gas emissions (up to 10 kt/day) occur during co-extrusive intervals, suggesting a degree of coupling between lava and gas, but gas emissions remain relatively high (~2,500 t/d) during inter-eruptive pauses. These passive emissions, which clearly persist for decades if not centuries, require a large volume of degassing but non-erupting magma beneath the volcano with a substantial exsolved volatile phase to feed the remarkable SO2 outgassing: an additional ~1.7–2 km3 basaltic andesite would be required to supply the excess SO2 emissions we observe in our study interval (2005 to present). That this volatile phase can ascend freely to the surface under most conditions is likely to be key to Bagana's largely effusive style of activity, in contrast with other persistently active silicic volcanoes where explosive and effusive eruptive styles alternate.","tags":[],"title":"Multi-year satellite observations of sulfur dioxide gas emissions and lava extrusion at Bagana volcano, Papua New Guinea","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R D'Aleo","M Bitetto","D Delle Donne","M Coltelli","D Coppola","BT McCormick Kilbride","E Pecora","M Ripepe","LC Salem","G Tamburello","A Aiuppa"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1547424000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547424000,"objectID":"83a102d153cac564d85470ee189c8ea0","permalink":"https://brendanvolc.github.io/publication/daleo2019-etna/","publishdate":"2019-01-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/daleo2019-etna/","section":"publication","summary":"The persistent open-vent activity of basaltic volcanoes is periodically interrupted by spectacular but hazardous paroxysmal explosions. The rapid transition from quiescence to explosive eruption poses a significant challenge for volcanic hazard assessment and mitigation, and improving our understanding of the processes that trigger these paroxysmal events is critical. Although magmatic gas is unquestionably the driver, direct measurements of a paroxysm's gas flux budget have remained challenging, to date. A particularly violent paroxysmal sequence took place on Etna on December 2015, intermittently involving all summit craters, especially the Voragine (VOR) that had previously displayed no activity for several years. Here, we characterize the volcano's SO2 degassing budget prior to, during and after this paroxysmal sequence, using ground-based (UV-Camera) and satellite (OMI) observations, complemented with ground- and space-borne thermal measurements. We make use of the high spatial resolution of UV-cameras to resolve SO2 emissions from the erupting VOR crater for the first time, and to characterize temporal switches in degassing activity from VOR to the nearby New Southeast Crater (NSEC). Our data show that onset of paroxysmal activity on December 3–5 was marked by visible escalation in VOR SO2 fluxes (4,700–8,900 tons/day), in satellite-derived thermal emissions (2,000 MW vs. ~2–11 MW in July-November 2015), and in OMI-derived daily SO2 masses (5.4 ± 0.7 to 10.0 ± 1.3 kilotonnes, kt; 0.5 kt was the average in the pre-eruptive period). Switch in volcanic activity from VOR to NSEC on December 6 was detected by increasing SO2 fluxes at the NSEC crater, and by decaying SO2 emissions at VOR, until activity termination on December 19. Taken together, our observations infer the total degassed SO2 mass for the entire VOR paroxysmal sequence at 21,000 ± 2,730 t, corresponding to complete degassing of ~1.9 ± 0.3 Mm3 of magma, or significantly less than the measured erupted magma volumes (5.1–12 Mm3). From this mismatch we propose that only a small fraction of the erupted magma was actually emplaced in the shallow plumbing system during (or shortly prior) the paroxysmal sequence. Rather, the majority of the erupted magma was likely stored conduit magma, having gone through extensive degassing for days to weeks prior to the paroxysm.","tags":[],"title":"Understanding the SO2 Degassing Budget of Mt Etna's Paroxysms: First Clues From the December 2015 Sequence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E Ilyinskaya","A Schmidt","TA Mather","FD Pope","C Witham","P Baxter","T Jóhannsson","M Pfeffer","S Barsotti","A Singh","P Sanderson","B Bergsson","BT McCormick Kilbride","A Donovan","N Peters","C Oppenheimer","M Edmonds"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1502755200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1502755200,"objectID":"fa1e6e2a29afeeb6adda1458e6aab01e","permalink":"https://brendanvolc.github.io/publication/ilyinskaya2017-holuhraun/","publishdate":"2017-08-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ilyinskaya2017-holuhraun/","section":"publication","summary":"The 2014–2015 Holuhraun eruption in Iceland, emitted ∼11 Tg of SO2 into the troposphere over 6 months, and caused one of the most intense and widespread volcanogenic air pollution events in centuries. This study provides a number of source terms for characterisation of plumes in large fissure eruptions, in Iceland and elsewhere. We characterised the chemistry of aerosol particle matter (PM) and gas in the Holuhraun plume, and its evolution as the plume dispersed, both via measurements and modelling. The plume was sampled at the eruptive vent, and in two populated areas in Iceland. The plume caused repeated air pollution events, exceeding hourly air quality standards (350 μg/m3) for SO2 on 88 occasions in Reykjahlíð town (100 km distance), and 34 occasions in Reykjavík capital area (250 km distance). Average daily concentration of volcanogenic PM sulphate exceeded 5 μg/m3 on 30 days in Reykjavík capital area, which is the maximum concentration measured during non-eruptive background interval. There are currently no established air quality standards for sulphate. Combining the results from direct sampling and dispersion modelling, we identified two types of plume impacting the downwind populated areas. The first type was characterised by high concentrations of both SO2 and S-bearing PM, with a high Sgas/SPM mass ratio (SO2(g)/(PM)  10). The second type had a low Sgas/SPM ratio (","tags":[],"title":"Understanding the environmental impacts of large fissure eruptions: Aerosol and gas emissions from the 2014–2015 Holuhraun eruption (Iceland)","type":"publication"}]
